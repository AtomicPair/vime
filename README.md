## Introduction

Vime — short for "VIM: Everywhere" — is a small utility for modern **Windows systems** that aims to duplicate the following basic functionality from the popular Vim text editor:

- Modal command editing, including `Normal`, `Insert`, and `Visual` modes.
- Basic file navigation, text manipulation, and text processing features.
- Custom key mappings for user-defined functions and other shortcuts.

Why bother with messy homemade scripts or costly third-party IDE add-ons when Vime can replicate most of the same features *in almost any window or text control*?

Oh, and did we mention that Vime is **completely free**? :-)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Vime is currently compatible with all modern versions of Windows, including Windows NT4, XP, Vista, and 7.  Compatibility has not yet been test on Windows 8, and we cannot guarantee that Vime will work on older installations of Windows 9x or ME.

### Users

1. To get started with the latest version Vime, **download** the latest version [here][DownloadLink].

2. Unzip the downloaded file to a temporary folder (such as your desktop or `My Documents` folder) and then copy the `release` folder hidden inside to a safe location (such as `C:\Program Files\Vime`). Vime is now **installed** on your system.

3. To **use** Vime, simply navigate to your new `Vime` folder and double-click the `Vime.exe` file. That's it!

4. For convenience, you may copy and paste the **shortcut** in your `Vime` folder to create a handy shortcut to the program on your desktop or favorite folder.

5. Once Vime is running, use the default `Ctrl+Shift+V` key combination to **enable or disable** the application.  To display a list of default **key mappings** for use with Vime, use the default `Ctrl+Shift+M` key combination.

*(Note: We are aware that while most Vime users should have little problem with the manual installation process described above, some people prefer to have a one-click solution install their desktop applications.  Rest assured, we are working to include a simple Windows installation package in future Vime releases to further simplify this installation process.)*

### Developers

1. To get started with the latest version Vime, clone or fork the repository [here][ProjectLink] to the local working directory of your choice.

2. Read the [Vime Developers Guide][DeveloperLink] in the [docs][DocsLink] folder for more detailed information about the project structure and other development considerations.
