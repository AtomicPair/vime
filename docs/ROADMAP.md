# Vime Feature Roadmap

Included below are all the current features we plan to implement into the Vime project.

* Add an appropriate unit test suite to support future development and code integrity.
* Add a simple menu system with an About, Options, and other dialogs to the current tray icon.
* Add an appropriate console- and/or file-logging subsystem to capture application errors.
* Add ability for users to redefine/override default key mappings for standard Vime functions.
* Add ability for users to define their own custom key combinations to be called for a given key mapping.
* Add ability to use application-specific settings and mappings.
* Add ability to change color and window format of Vime status bar.

If there are any features you would like to see added to the Vime project, you have two options:

1. Open a new ticket on the project's [Issues page][IssuesLink] and tag it with the `feature` label.
2. Fork the repository, code your suggestions, then submit a pull request back to the project.
